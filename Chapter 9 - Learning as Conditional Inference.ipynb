    "The line between \"reasoning\" and \"learning\" is unclear in cognition.\n",
    "Just as reasoning can be seen as a form of conditional inference, so can learning: discovering persistent facts about the world (for example, causal processes or causal properties of objects).\n",
    "By saying that we are learning \"persistent\" facts we are indicating that there is something to infer which we expect to be relevant to many observations over time.\n",
    "Thus, we will formulate learning as inference in a model that (1) has a fixed latent value of interest, the *hypothesis*, and (2) has a sequence of observations, the *data points*. \n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about learning as inference, there are several key questions. First, what can be inferred about the hypothesis given a certain subset of the observed data? For example, in most cases, you cannot learn much about the weight of an object based on its color. However, if there is a correlation between weight and color -- as is the case in many children's toys -- observing color does allow you to learn about weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, what is the relationship between the amount of input (how much data we've observed) and the knowledge gained? In psychology, this relationship is often characterized with a *learning curve*, representing a belief as a function of amount of data. \n",
    "In general, getting more data allows us to update our beliefs. But some data, in some models, has a much bigger effect. \n",
    "In addition, while knowledge often changes gradually as data is accumulated, it sometimes jumps in non-linear ways; these are usually the most psychologically interesting predictions."

Recall how earlier we used stochastic functions with no inputs, or *thunks*, to describe coins of different weights.  Each such function now represents a hypothesis about the process generating our observations.  In the program below, the function `coin` represents these hypotheses.  The higher-order function `make-coin` takes one input, `weight`, and returns a `coin` thunk with that weight embedded in its definition.\n",

This is because the data set used for learning is different on each run. This is a feature, not a bug: real learners have idiosyncratic experience, even if they are all drawn from the same distribution. Of course, we are often interested in the average behavior of an ideal learner: we could average this plot over many randomly chosen data sets, simulating many different learners. \n",

If we set `fairPrior` to be 0.5, equal for the two alternative hypotheses, just 5 heads in a row are sufficient to favor the trick coin by a large margin.  If `fairPrior` is 99 in 100, 10 heads in a row are sufficient.  We have to increase `fairPrior` quite a lot, however, before 15 heads in a row is no longer sufficient evidence for a trick coin: even at `fairPrior` = 0.9999, 15 heads without a single tail still weighs in favor of the trick coin.  This is because the evidence in favor of a trick coin accumulates exponentially as the data set increases in size; each successive `h` flip increases the evidence by nearly a factor of 2.\n",

Here, the fact that somewhere between 10 and 15 heads in a row is sufficient to convince most people that the coin is a trick coin suggests that for most people, the a priori probability of encountering a trick coin in this situation is somewhere between 1 in a 100 and 1 in 10,000---a reasonable range.  Of course, if you begin with the suspicion that any friend who offers you a coin to flip is liable to have a trick coin in his pocket, then just seeing five heads in a row should already make you very suspicious---as we can see by setting `fairPrior` to a value such as 0.9.\n",

    "The previous examples represent perhaps simple cases of learning.  Typical learning problems in human cognition or AI are more complex in many ways.  For one, learners are almost always confronted with more than two hypotheses about the causal structure that might underlie their observations.  Indeed, hypothesis spaces for learning are often infinite.  Countably infinite hypothesis spaces are encountered in models of learning for domains traditionally considered to depend on \"discrete\" or \"symbolic\" knowledge; hypothesis spaces of grammars in language acquisition are a canonical example.  Hypothesis spaces for learning in domains traditionally considered more \"continuous\", such as perception or motor control, are typically uncountable and parametrized by one or more continuous dimensions.  In causal learning, both discrete and continuous hypothesis spaces typically arise.  (In statistics, making conditional inferences over continuous hypothesis spaces given data is often called *parameter estimation*.)\n",

    "We can explore a basic case of learning with continuous hypothesis spaces by slightly enriching our coin flipping example.  Suppose instead of simply flipping a coin to determine which of two coin weights to use, we can choose *any* coin weight between 0 and 1.\n",

We call the distribution of samples produced by conditional inference on data the *conditional distribution*, or sometimes the *posterior distribution*, to contrast with the prior distribution expressing our a priori beliefs.

The spread of the conditional distribution reflects a notion of confidence in our beliefs about the coin weight.  The distribution becomes more sharply peaked as we observe more data, because each flip, as an independent sample of the process we are learning about, provides additional evidence of the process's unknown parameters.\n",

    "It is easy to see that this model doesn't really capture our intuitions about coins, or at least not in everyday scenarios.  Imagine that you have just received a quarter in change from a store -- or even better, taken it from a nicely wrapped-up roll of quarters that you have just picked up from a bank.  Your prior expectation at this point is that the coin is almost surely fair.  If you flip it 10 times and get 7 heads out of 10, you'll think nothing of it; that could easily happen with a fair coin and there is no reason to suspect the weight of this particular coin is anything other than 0.5.  But running the above query with uniform prior beliefs on the coin weight, you'll guess the weight in this case is around 0.7. Our hypothesis generating function needs to be able to draw `coinWeight` not from a uniform distribution, but from some other function that can encode various expectations about how likely the coin is to be fair, skewed towards heads or tails, and so on. \n",
