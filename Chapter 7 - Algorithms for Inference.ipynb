A common option for continuous state spaces is to sample a new state from a multivariate Gaussian centered on the current state. To turn a proposal distribution into a transition function with the right stationary distribution, we either accepting or reject the proposed transition with probability: $\\min\\left(1, \\frac{p(x')q(x'\\rightarrow x)}{p(x)q(x\\rightarrow x')}\\right).$\n",

It can be shown that the *Metropolis-hastings algorithm* gives a transition probability (i.e. $\\pi(x\\rightarrow x')$) that satisfies detailed balance and thus balance.

When the input to a `factor` statement is a function of multiple variables, those variables become correlated in the posterior distribution. If the induced correlation is particularly strong, MCMC can sometimes become 'stuck.' In controling the random walk, Metropolis-Hastings choses a new point in probability space to go to and then decides whether or not to go based on the probability of the new point. If it has difficulty finding new points with reasonable probability, it will get stuck and simplly stay where it is. Given an infinite amount of time, Metropolis-Hastings will recover. However, the first N samples will be heavily dependent on where the chain started (the first sample) and will be a poor approximation of the true posterior. \n",

    "In earlier chapters we introduced the `factor` and `observe` keywords as soft alternatives to the hard `condition` statement in WebPPL.  While the notion of `condition`ing on an observation being true is conceptually straight-forward, it should now be clearer from the details of algorithms what its computational drawbacks might be. In our model above, any given observation is *a priori* exremely unlikey, since our target can appear anywhere. For obvious reasons, rejection sampling will work poorly, since the chance that a random sample from a Gaussian will take on exactly the value `x` is negligible. Thus, randomly sampling and only retaining the samples where the Gaussian did take on the value `x` is an inefficient strategy. MCMC similarly has difficulty when the vast majority of possible parameter settings have probability 0. (Why?) In contrast, `factor` and `observe` provide a much softer constraint: parameter values that do not give rise to our observations are lower-probability, but not impossible. "

Non-parametric methods are highly flexible but can require a very many expensive samples. \n",

    "On the other side of the same coin, we have [*parametric*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_statistics) representations--that is, we can try to design and fit a parameterized density function to approximate the posterior distribution. By definition a parametric function can be described by some finite number of parameters. For instance, a Gaussian is fully described by two numbers: its mean and standard deviation. By approximating a complex posterior distribution within a parametric family, we can often acheive reasonabe result much more quickly. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, however, if the true posterior is badly fit by the family we will never get good results.\n",
