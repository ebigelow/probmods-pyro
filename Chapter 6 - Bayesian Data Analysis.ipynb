    "To learn more about (and test) the tug-of-war model, we're going to connect it to the data from the experiment.\n",

    "Above, we set these parameters to be `0.5` and `0.3`, respectively.\n",
    "People are lazy about a third of the time, and when they are lazy, they pull with half their strength.\n",
    "(Technical note: Because we are comparing relative strengths and we have normalized the human ratings, we don't have to infer the parameters of the gaussian in `strength`.\n",
    "We just use the standard normal distribution.)\n",

    "Rather than guessing at what values we should put for these parameters, we can use the data to inform our beliefs about what those parameters are likely to be (assuming the general model is a good one)."
