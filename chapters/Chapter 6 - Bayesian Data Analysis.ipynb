    "A model can be used to make predictions about different tasks.\n",
    "Models are useful in this way: *They are tools for thinking through the implications of hypotheses*.\n",
    "In this model, we formalized the hypothesis that people reason about the weight of a coin by assuming the outcomes they observe (i.e., the 15 out of 20 heads) are independent results of spinning the coin, which has some unknown proclivity to be spun to heads.\n",
    "This reasoning supports responses to other types of questions such as \"How likely is the next spin to land on heads?\".\n",
    "We use the same model to see what our hypothesis predicts given this new question.\n",
    "Each question could be thought of as a different experiment you could run to test the same hypothesis/model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we have one hypothesis about a person thinking about the spinning coins experiments.\n",
    "There are other hypotheses we could make about this experiment.\n",
    "Rather than have uniform prior beliefs, maybe people port their knowledge of flipping behavior, and believe with some probability that spinning coins will behave similarly: There is a reasonable chance that spinning coins is as random as flipping coins.\n",
    "But if that belief is not well supported, the observer can accommodate that by inferring that the behavior of spinning coins is quite different than that of flipping coins (as I explained above). If the observer believes the behavior of spinning coins is *different* than that of flipping coins, the model takes on the form of the model above: uniform beliefs about `p`.\n",
    "We'll call the new model that assumes people's expectations about spinning behavior are influenced by their knowledge of flipping behavior (namely, the observer believes the behavior of spinning coins could be the *same* as that of flipping coins) the `skeptical_model` because it is, in a way, skeptical of the story I told you above about spinning coins."
